# env-config-private-template

This is a template for storing private data in association with my [env-config](https://github.com/codisms/env-config)
repository and [dev-env-setup](https://github.com/codisms/dev-env-setup) script.  If you wish to use these, you can set up
a repository of your own that populates the files included with your own keys and passwords.  **_Do not commit this to a
public repository!_**
